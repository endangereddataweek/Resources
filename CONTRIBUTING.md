## What should I know before I get started?

### First steps

Connect with us on [the Endangered Data Week Etherpad](https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/endangereddataweek)! We'll be using the Etherpad for the 2018 Mozilla Global Sprint, and there will be information there about additional ways to contribute, check in with us, or otherwise participate.

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

Please report unacceptable behavior to the [project leads](README.md#open-project-leads). [brandontlocke@gmail.com](mailto:brandontlocke@gmail.com) and/or [jason@jasonheppler.org](mailto:jason@jasonheppler.org).

### Endangered Data Week

Endangered Data Week is a collaborative effort coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions to shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. The week's events can promote care for endangered collections by: publicizing the availability of datasets; increasing critical engagement with them, including through visualization and analysis; and by encouraging political activism for open data policies and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation.

This repository specifically hosts **Endangered Data Week resources**, designed to provide information about workshops, flyers, and promotional material. Other repositories currently include:

- the [Endangered Data Week website](https://github.com/endangereddataweek/endangereddataweek.org)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Endangered Data Week? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* Beginner issues `beginner` - issues which should only require a few lines of code or writing.
* Help wanted issues `help-wanted` - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Submitting Workshop Material

We're eager to help people work with data, and eagerly welcome contributions of workshop material that others can reuse and remix. This section guides you through submitting a workshop for Endangered Data Week, with a focus on brand new materials. Please use these guidelines to help the project leads and the community understand your suggestions.

#### How Do I Submit A Workshop?

Workshops won't always be tracked as [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), and we're fine with duplicate workshops as long as there's some level of difference between them. To generate new workshop material, you can follow these steps:

* **Fork this repository** to your own Github account.
* **Create a new folder** for your workshop. Following the other naming conventions for workshops by prepending a folder name with `workshop-`. If there's a folder with the same name as your folder, append your last name or institution (for example, `workshop-data-science-uno`).
* **Place your workshop material in this folder** with some light structuring, including: slides, data, code, images, or other supporting material that might be needed. However, if your slides are already hosted elsewhere (like Google), you can skip this step and move to the next one.
* **Place a README.md in your folder** that explains: the title of the workshop; a short description of the workshops goals; a general sense of experience levels for those attending the workshop; and a point-of-contact for those involved in creating the workshop. If you're linking to a workshop hosted elsewhere, place a link to the slides/material within this README.
* **Update the README.md** in the top-level directory. Find the section called *Workshops* and provide a title, name, license, and link to your workshop within the repository so others can find your material easily.
* **Once your material is ready** send us a [pull request](#pull-request) to notify us that changes need review.
* **You're done!** If we have questions for you or need more information, we may deny the pull request and ask for more details.

### Telling Your Data Stories

We want to hear your stories about how data that becomes endangered, threatened, neglected, or lost impacts your work. We're collecting your data stories, which are written contributions that can be as short as a couple sentences or as long as a couple pages. You can fill out our [Endangered Data Stories form](https://goo.gl/forms/Ex2FPNJKVdqN218I3) to share stories about your use of open data for research, advocacy, teaching, or business, or talk about the impact of a loss of access to open data.

If you want to add photos, video, or your own formatting, you can also:

* **Fork this repository** to your own Github account.
* **Find the `data-stories` repository** in this repo. Inside should be a collection of individual Markdown files. You should feel free to use any of these files as a template.
* **Create a new Markdown file** either in [Github's interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/) or on your own machine. 
* **Write your data story** in this new file. Your text here can be as long or as short as you'd like. And remember to sign it by placing your name (and institution, if you'd like) at the *top* of the file. Please sign your document this way:

> lastName: Heppler  
> displayName: Jason Heppler  
> institution: University of Nebraska  
> url: https://jasonheppler.org

* **Save the document** and send us a [pull request](#pull-request) with `Data Stories` in the submission title.
* **You're done!** We'll review the pull request once we recieve it, and get back to you with any questions we might have.

### Translate materials
Right now all of our materials are only available in English, but we would love for these to be accessible to broader populations.

If you'd like to translate:

    Fork the repository
    Duplicate the file you'd like to translate
    Add the language at the end of the filename (e.g. data-prep-spanish)
    Create a pull request

If you're not comfortable with Github, feel free to send a translation to the [open project leads](https://github.com/endangereddataweek/resources#open-project-leads)!

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Endangered Data Week, including completely new contributions and minor improvements to existing workshops, the website, promotional material, or resources. Following these guidelines helps the project leads and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#endangered-data-week).**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aendangered+data+week)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#endangered-data-week) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to Endangered Data Week.
* **List some other events or applications where this enhancement exists.**
